I am currently an AI resident at the <a href="https://www.tri.global">Toyota Research Institute</a>, where I work on developing multimodal models for applications in material science. I completed my M.Sc. at <a href="https://www.mcgill.ca/">McGill University</a> and <a href="https://mila.quebec/en/">Mila</a> supervised by <a href="https://www.cim.mcgill.ca/~derek/">Derek Nowrouzezahrai</a> and <a href="https://saebrahimi.github.io/">Samira Ebrahimi Kahou</a>. My research interests span <b>probabilistic inference, multimodal generative models, Large Language Models (LLMs), and causality</b>. I am also passionate about writing GPU-efficient code. 

During my master's, I worked on problems at the intersection of causal discovery and representation learning, some of them involving <a href="https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2021/hash/e614f646836aaed9f89ce58e837e2310-Abstract.html">GFlowNets</a>. My thesis was on learning a joint distribution over causal variables, structures, and mechanisms from low-level data. In 2024, I was a visiting researcher at ServiceNow Research, where I worked on change point detection in temporal causal models, and  benchmarking text-conditioned forecasting capabilities of LLMs. I spent summer 2023 as a research scientist intern at Amazon training large-scale models for long-term revenue forecasting.

Before my graduate studies, I completed my undergrad from <a href="https://www.nitt.edu">NIT Trichy</a>, India. As a research intern with the <a href="https://www.cmu.edu/scs/robotutor/join-the-team/index.html">RoboTutor Team</a> at <a href="https://www.cmu.edu">Carnegie Mellon University</a>, under <a href="https://www.ri.cmu.edu/ri-faculty/jack-mostow/">Jack Mostow</a>, I applied reinforcement learning to develop a personalized Intelligent Tutoring System for underprivileged students in Tanzania. I also explored machine learning for security during a research internship at <a href="https://www.berkeley.edu">UC Berkeley</a> with <a href="https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Faculty/Homepages/song.html">Dawn Song</a> and <a href="https://www.uvm.edu/~jnear/">Joseph Near</a>.

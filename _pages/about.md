I am an M.Sc. student at <a href="https://www.mcgill.ca/">McGill University</a> and <a href="https://mila.quebec/en/">Mila</a> supervised by <a href="https://www.cim.mcgill.ca/~derek/">Derek Nowrouzezahrai</a> and <a href="https://saebrahimi.github.io/">Samira Ebrahimi Kahou</a>. My research interests span <b>probabilistic inference, causality, Large Language Models (LLMs), generative models, and drug discovery</b>. During my master's program, I worked on research problems at the intersection of causal discovery and representation learning, some of them involving <a href="https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2021/hash/e614f646836aaed9f89ce58e837e2310-Abstract.html">GFlowNets</a>. My thesis centers on learning a joint distribution over causal variables, structures, and mechanisms from low-level data.

In 2023, I spent my summer as a research scientist intern at <a href="https://www.amazon.science">Amazon Science</a> where I worked on training large-scale models for long-term revenue forecasting.

Prior to my graduate studies at McGill, I completed my undergrad from <a href="https://www.nitt.edu">NIT Trichy</a>, India. During my junior year, I joined the <a href="https://www.cmu.edu/scs/robotutor/join-the-team/index.html">RoboTutor Team</a> at <a href="https://www.cmu.edu">Carnegie Mellon University</a> as a research intern supervised by <a href="https://www.ri.cmu.edu/ri-faculty/jack-mostow/">Jack Mostow</a>, where I used Reinforcement Learning to build a personalized Intelligent Tutoring System for underprivileged students in Tanzania. I also had the opportunity to explore machine learning in the context of security when I was a remote research intern at <a href="https://www.berkeley.edu">UC Berkeley</a> with <a href="https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Faculty/Homepages/song.html">Dawn Song</a> and <a href="https://www.uvm.edu/~jnear/">Joseph Near</a>.
